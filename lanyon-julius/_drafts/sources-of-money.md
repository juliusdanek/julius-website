## 1. Sources of money

Sources of money and actors in the venture financing business are abundant. There are angels, accelerators, incubators, VC funds, strategic funds, institutional investors, friends and family, grants, and so on and so on. How should you know what is right for you and what is not? VC money definitely is not always the right answer, as this [blogpost by Laurie Peterson](http://www.fastcompany.com/3036130/hit-the-ground-running/why-venture-capital-wasnt-right-for-me-and-15-alternative-funding-sou) perfectly illustrates. She also provides an excellent overview over the type of sources of funding that you can leverage next to traditional VC funding. 

Especially companies in seed or early funding stage can often profit from alternative funding models to traditional, large VCs. The infographic below demonstrates that VCs have been reluctant to make seed stage investments in recent years, even though the sums of money have increased. Early stage deals have been faring better but the number has been decreasing as of this quarter. This evidence clearly warrants a second look at the alternatives, some of which I will illustrate in this post. I will not cover traditional VCs but will assume that the reader is familiar with what a VC fund is.

### "Free Money"

The first option to consider when fundraising are sources of "free money", i.e. money that does not imply relinquishing equity in the company or taking on debt obligations. I would differentiate between three major categories here:
<!-- Talk about grants, competitions, summer programs, include links -->
#### 1. Grants and government schemes

Grants are an extremely useful way to receive funding for early stage research. Grants are usually an option in university environments and are tied to specific types of research.
<!-- research financing with grants -->

#### 2. Competitions

Grasshopper has compiled a great list with many available startup competitions(http://grasshopper.com/blog/startup-competition-guide/). 
There is an abundance of entrepreneurship competitions throughout the US and Europe. Most competitions hand out cash-prizes and in many cases offer additional benefits such as consulting, engineering expertise or introductions to further programs. Grasshopper has compiled a great list with many available [startup competitions](http://grasshopper.com/blog/startup-competition-guide/). 

<!-- The list below contains a continuously updated list of competitions with prizes. **Feel free to submit competitions [here](TODO: INSERT LINK) for inclusion on the list**
 -->

<!-- Make list with competitions, main prize, location and focus -->

#### 3. Summer programs

Summer programs are another great way to raise money free of cost with the added benefit of mentorship and often office space for several months. The mentorship aspect is actually the most valuable aspect of the offer. Usually, teams participating in those types of programs are strung together in "classes" and go through the program together. The lessons learned from one another plus many bonus programs, workshops and mentorship lessons that the accelerators offer make these programs tremendously valuable. Since many of these programs are conducted by VCs or by major universities, they are also an excellent opportunity expand your network for possible future funding. 

Some of the more prominent summer programs are:

[Summer@Highland](http://summer.hcp.com/): Check out their blog at http://summerathighland.tumblr.com/ for more details and to know what being part of a summer program is like.

[Lightspeed Ventures Fellowship](http://lsvp.com/summer-fellowships/)

[MIT GFSA accelerator](http://entrepreneurship.mit.edu/accelerator/)

<!-- Make list with accelerators and find example blogpost that shows a day in an accelerator.  -->

The caveat with these sources is that you can absolutely not plan for or rely on them. Especially in grants the application process might be very lengthy and burdensome. Competitions and summer programs however are definitely an important stepping stone, giving entrepreneurs the opportunity to re-work pitches, to network and to gain general public exposure for their company.

### Angels, Angel Funds and Micro-VCs

Angels in a nutshell are wealthy individuals that usually have either founded a company before or accumulated significant industry expertise. Angels commonly invest between $100.000 to $1.000.000, or more in exceptional cases. For a brief summary on angel investors, read http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/52742. Next to providing initial seed money, angel investors can be of tremendous help with their usually extensive networks and expertise. Angel investors have the reputation to not make money in the fundraising community as many of their investments are in very risky early stage or seed companies. Studies have shown this conception [not to be true](http://www.angelblog.net/Angel_Returns.html). For some further reading on angels, visit:

Angel investor groups have nuanced differences as well.

* Angel groups: Angel investor groups or funds consist of several angels that have joined forces in order to combine expertise and to pool financial resources, allowing greater investments. They usually average around 100 members, are region-specific and can differ in the industries they invest in.

* Angel funds: Angel funds pool individual angels money into a fund that then gets invested. Entrepreneurs have the advantage of having access to larger monetary funds. The fund managers can find the individual angels invested in the fund that would be the best fit for the company as advisors.

* Angel syndicates: Angel list provides the opportunity for syndicates to co-invest in companies. Hereby individual angels make a pledge to a company and other angels make follow-on investments. The investment of one angel hereby acts as a "social proof" or seal of approval. Usually super star angels will have several followers willing to make co-investments. Thus, secure an investment from one and you might get a few follow-ons.

Micro-VCs are venture capital funds with smaller amounts of assets under management (AUM), usually below $50m but up to about $100m. Micro-VCs primarily engage in seed and early-stage deals and invest smaller amounts of money. The current early stage average deal size for Micro-VCs is $3.4m. I have included several links for great readings on micro-VCs here:

### Accelerators

Quoting [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_accelerator) here:

> Seed accelerators also known as startup accelerators are fixed-term, cohort-based programs, that include mentorship and educational components and culminate in a public pitch event or demo day. While traditional business incubators are often government-funded, generally take no equity, and focus on biotech, medical technology, clean tech or product-centric companies, accelerators can be either privately or publicly funded and focus on a wide range of industries.

The main differences between business incubators and accelerators are:

    The application process is open to anyone, but highly competitive. Y Combinator and TechStars have application acceptance rates between 1% and 3%.
    A seed investment in the startups is usually made, in exchange for equity. Typically, the investment is between US$20,000 and US$50,000 (or £10,000 and £50,000 in Europe)
    The focus is on small teams, not on individual founders. Accelerators consider that one person is insufficient to handle all the work associated with a startup.
    The startups must "graduate" by a given deadline, typically after 3 months. During this time, they receive intensive mentoring and training, and they are expected to iterate rapidly. Virtually all accelerators end their programs with a "Demo Day", where the startups present to investors.
    Startups are accepted and supported in cohort batches or classes (the accelerator isn't an on-demand resource). The peer support and feedback that the classes provide is an important advantage. If the accelerator doesn't offer a common workspace, the teams will meet periodically.

### Conclusion

There is an abundance of alternative funding forms out there. In this post I have tried to give a snapshot. In my the next section - "How to choose the right investor" - I want to cover some of the strategies and caveats when looking for the right investor. 

Feel free to leave comments for feedback and pointing out mistakes :-)

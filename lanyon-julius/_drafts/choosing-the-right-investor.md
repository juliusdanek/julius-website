## What matters when choosing the source of money

In this section I will highlight a few findings without going into depth and numbers in every heading. I highly recommend reading [this report on VC trends](http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/Global_venture_capital_insights_and_trends_2014/$FILE/EY_Global_VC_insights_and_trends_report_2014.pdf) that is the source for many of my insights. 

### Region

As is well known and documented, funding is geographically very unequally distributed. The US has the largest VC industry in the world by far (68% of global VC activity in 2013) and within the US, Silicon Valley reaps most of the VC dollars, having funding share between 40-60% in the past years. Regional differences also exist with regard to the company you are looking to get funded. Boston for example is well known for its biotech startup scene but less so for mobile applications. 

I recommend further readings to understand regional differences in funding landscape:

* [US VC investment spanning 160 Cities](http://nvca.org/pressreleases/u-s-venture-capital-investment-spanned-160-cities-2014/)
* [Silicon Valley financing Comparison](https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/silicon-valley-financing-comparison/)
* [Q1 2015 Regional Investment Data](http://nvca.org/?ddownload=1841)

## Hi! Welcome to my blog. 

Why start a blog in the first place? As I graduated from [MIT](http://mit.edu) last Friday, June 5th, I decided to move out to California to continue the coding education that I began last year in September. Setting up my own website and blog seems like a logical extension of my continued practical education. 

What do I want to achieve during my time in Cali? I am not sure whether I will be able to make it as a fully fledged software developer, the more I learn the more I realize that there is so much more to it then simply learning how to code and my visa simply isn't long enough to give me enough time to compete with the people that major in computer science. I do however want to get an understanding that is thorough enough so I can 

* understand the basic principles of programming 
* talk the lingo of computer scientists
* be able to read and understand snippets of code
* explore to connect the different pieces of code through requests, API's, databases, etc.

My aim is ultimately to completely understand the process of how a web application or an iOS application works. How does it connect to a database? How does it communicate with a webserver? What are the current trends in the industry? I am very excited to be exploring these questions in the next couple of months. 

In the end I would like to be able to use the technical skills I learned in conjunction with the finance and business skills that I have acquired during my education both at MIT and at Utrecht. The role of a product manager seems to perfectly fit this description. Ideally, I would like to grow into this role by starting my own business. 

Over the next weeks and months I will be blogging about all kinds of things: 

* Technical posts explaining what projects I do, I did them and what resources I used
* Thoughts about entrepreneurship (I know there is lot of stuff about this out there already but this will be from my perspective)
* My journey, what I am going through, where I am, what I am doing
* Random Ramblings

I am excited to be writing about these things and having people be part of my journey.

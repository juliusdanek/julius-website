## I can't believe it!

Fallout 4 has been announced a few days ago at the E3. I have spent a ton of time playing both the immediate predecessors Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas as well as Fallout 2, back in the day.

Why do I love this game so much? It has all the ingredients an incredible game needs in my eyes:

* It's a role playing game with an amazing character and leveling system, skills that make sense and a system that levels up skills when used (your lockpicking skill will increase if you successfully pick a lock)
* It is extremely atmospheric.** Bethesda Softworks puts a lot of detailed thought into how to make a game world as credible as possible with dozens and dozens of characters, well-thought out story lines and wonderful landscapes
* The post-apocalyptic scenario: Come on, who wouldn't want to see what the world would look like after a catastrophe - even though I obviously wouldn't actually want this to happen.
* Pip-Boy

Among the newly announced features is the possibility to build your own settlements and houses - something that I have dearly missed in Bethesda games since you could pseudo-develop your own settlement in ES III: Bloodmoon.

The game will be released on November 10 this year! I am so incredibly excited - I dearly hope I will have the time to play this game.

Until then I am playing Fallout Shelter - a game for iOS that Bethesda just released. It's perfect for short breaks on your way to work.

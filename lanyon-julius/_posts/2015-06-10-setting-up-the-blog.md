It literally took me forever to set this up, going through motions of despair as I decided to go with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) as a blogging solution.

Why Jekyll? Well, basically because my buddy [Matt](http://matthewsniff.com) recommended it to me and it looked like it would amount to a challenge. I thought about doing Wordpress but did not want to learn PHP first or simply deploy a beginners website. This is why I chose to use Jekyll and a theme called [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon). 

Lanyon seemed like a beautiful theme that would go well with the style of my webpage. Initially I had tried to set up the blog on my webpage but that didn't quite work out due to my server restrictions (more about that in another blog post). I decided to go with [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) when writing these posts for now since it seems to be fairly standard with Jekyll.

## Why coding?

<!-- Add part1 and part 2 hyperlinks so they are connected -->
I decided to split this post into two parts. Part 1 explaining what led up to me starting to code and part 2 explaining why I enjoy coding. 

<p class="message">
	Julius, why have you started coding, what are you hoping to accomplish?
</p>

I have been asked this question many times over the past months. My interest in technology and computers reaches far back. In my childhood and teenage years however it was rather geared or "misdirected" towards computer games (even though I do not regret a single moment playing all those awesome games). 

# Economics and identity crisis

After graduating high school and an identity crisis with no real idea what my real interests where I decided to study economics - it seemed like a reasonable choice at the time, offering job security and heck, everybody was doing it! It promised to apply mathematics to solve real world problems and that really intrigued me. 

I did enjoy studying economics, I do believe it is one of the most profound and influential academic fields (whether it is a science is at least debatable: [yes](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/21/opinion/yes-economics-is-a-science.html), [no](http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/12/13/economics-science-wang/), [maybe](http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/robert-j--shilleron-whether-he-is-a-scientist)). The mathematical problems were challenging and some of the models very interesting. However, besides on paper I did not feel like I was actually accomplishing much. 

Computer science was not on my radar at all. My cousin [Fabian](https://de.linkedin.com/in/fabianruffy) was a computer science major at LMU MÃ¼nchen and when I observed him studying all the Boolean logic and assembly language I was happy that I was doing the 'easier' economics math work. 


# Back to tech

In 2011 then, with an internship in VC in New York I started getting exposure to finance and its role in facilitating technological progress. Being exposed to many ideas and entrepreneurs made me curious about the realm of tech and startups and I started reading up on ideas, blogs, newspaper articles, etc. When I came to MIT originally a year ago for my Master's degree, I was planning on either 

* launching my own company or
* working at a VC firm

The environment at MIT however drove me to try out something else completely, coding. I had built a website before, the previous version of [www.entrefem.de](http://entrefem.de) with the help of a friend, a template and lots of patchwork (my friend told me I totally messed up the code more than once). This time however I wanted to get down to the nit and grit. I felt that being at MIT I did not want to be reduced only to me being a 'Sloanie'. I wanted to be on the tech side as well, even if it was just basics and talking the lingo. 

I began my journey with a popular starting point: 

[Codecademy](www.cadecademy.org)

Codecademy was a great starting point as it was

1. Free
2. Designed for beginners
3. Motivational

And so I began taking coding classes online and at MIT, steadily being sucked into the world of computer science.

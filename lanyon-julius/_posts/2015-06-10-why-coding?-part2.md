## Why coding?

<!-- TODO: Finish inserting links into part 1 & 2 -->

I decided to split this post into two parts. Part 1 explaining what led up to me starting to code and part 2 explaining why I enjoy coding. 

<p class="message">
	Julius, why have you started coding, what are you hoping to accomplish?
</p>

# Codecademy

I started off easy, learning HTML and CSS, which, quite frankly, I do not enjoy as much. They are pretty simple but do not actually have much to do with coding or programming. 
When I came to JavaScript and jQuery, it got more interesting. 

For people with no exposure to coding, a quick explanation of these languages:

<dl>
  <dt>HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</dt>
  <dd>The language used to describe and define the content of a Web page. HTML is found throughout the web and basically acts as a scaffolding for a website. Inside the scaffolding you can place content like texts, images, texts, etc. You can see what html looks like <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_basic_document">here</a></dd>

  <dt>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</dt>
  <dd>Used to describe the appearance of Web content. CSS is like a fancy interior designer that makes sure that your website looks awesome, has nice colors and that all the same elements like a paragraph or a header look the same. If you are Firefox you can see what your websites look like without CSS by going to "View --> Pagestyle --> No Style". This sometimes also happens to websites, for example when you go on Facebook and it just shows a white background and blue links, that means that the CSS files failed to load.</dd>

  <dt>JavaScript (JS)</dt>
  <dd>The programming language used to build advanced Web sites and applications. Javascript is a "real" programming language. You can research it in more detail online but in the context of a simple website it basically powers animations, button clicks, and other dynamic interactions. You can liken it to the doors and lightswitches in your house.
  jQuery is an an extension of JavaScript that allows to manipulate effects easily on your website, much like a toolbox. 
   </dd>

JavaScript first introduced me to basic programming concepts such as if statements, for loops, variable declarations, functions, etc. To show the usage of these concepts, codecademy let's you code very simple programs like basic calculators, grocery lists, and so on. 

It was not until I started learning Python however that coding fully ignited my passion. Python is generally seen as a language that is easy to learn and that can be applied in many different contexts. Below is a very simple and elegant example of how you can add two numbers by defining a function. 

{% highlight python %}
// Create a function that takes two arguments and returns the sum of those arguments

def adder(a, b):
	return a + b

// Call the function

adder(2, 6)

// > 8

{% endhighlight %}

The logic behind it is extremely powerful and intuitive. Python exposed me to the first problems that required me to really sit down for several hours and just do problem solving, for example:

> Write a function that takes a list of numbers and only returns those that are divisible by 3. 

There are many many ways to solve this. The feeling you get when the desired answers finally prints to your screen and without error is incredible. This feeling of instant gratification is incredible and I have not encountered it elsewhere. Before computer programming, the only time I could ever concentrate continuously for several hours on thing was when solving math problems that were hard but had a solution somewhere on the horizon.

I realize that my teaching myself I will hardly ever challenge a computer science major in their own field, but teaching myself the practical skills while simultaneously diving into what constitutes the underlying structure the digital and tech world is something that I yearn to do. Learning how to code seems like the perfect way to do it and I am enjoying it tremendously - just as the MIT motto says: 'mens et manus'.

        Why coding? - Part 1

    <h2 id="why-coding">Why coding?</h2>

<!-- Add part1 and part 2 hyperlinks so they are connected -->
<p>I decided to split this post into two parts. Part 1 explaining what led up to me starting to code and part 2 explaining why I enjoy coding.</p>

<p class="message">
	Julius, why have you started coding, what are you hoping to accomplish?
</p>

<p>I have been asked this question many times over the past months. My interest in technology and computers reaches far back. In my childhood and teenage years however it was rather geared or “misdirected” towards computer games (even though I do not regret a single moment playing all those awesome games).</p>

<h1 id="economics-and-identity-crisis">Economics and identity crisis</h1>

<p>After graduating high school and an identity crisis with no real idea what my real interests where I decided to study economics - it seemed like a reasonable choice at the time, offering job security and heck, everybody was doing it! It promised to apply mathematics to solve real world problems and that really intrigued me.</p>

<p>I did enjoy studying economics, I do believe it is one of the most profound and influential academic fields (whether it is a science is at least debatable: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/21/opinion/yes-economics-is-a-science.html">yes</a>, <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/12/13/economics-science-wang/">no</a>, <a href="http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/robert-j--shilleron-whether-he-is-a-scientist">maybe</a>). The mathematical problems were challenging and some of the models very interesting. However, besides on paper I did not feel like I was actually accomplishing much.</p>

<p>Computer science was not on my radar at all. My cousin <a href="https://de.linkedin.com/in/fabianruffy">Fabian</a> was a computer science major at LMU München and when I observed him studying all the Boolean logic and assembly language I was happy that I was doing the ‘easier’ economics math work.</p>

<h1 id="back-to-tech">Back to tech</h1>

<p>In 2011 then, with an internship in VC in New York I started getting exposure to finance and its role in facilitating technological progress. Being exposed to many ideas and entrepreneurs made me curious about the realm of tech and startups and I started reading up on ideas, blogs, newspaper articles, etc. When I came to MIT originally a year ago for my Master’s degree, I was planning on either</p>

<ul>
  <li>launching my own company or</li>
  <li>working at a VC firm</li>
</ul>

<p>The environment at MIT however drove me to try out something else completely, coding. I had built a website before, the previous version of <a href="http://entrefem.de">www.entrefem.de</a> with the help of a friend, a template and lots of patchwork (my friend told me I totally messed up the code more than once). This time however I wanted to get down to the nit and grit. I felt that being at MIT I did not want to be reduced only to me being a ‘Sloanie’. I wanted to be on the tech side as well, even if it was just basics and talking the lingo.</p>

<p>I began my journey with a popular starting point:</p>

<p><a href="www.cadecademy.org">Codecademy</a></p>

<p>Codecademy was a great starting point as it was</p>

<ol>
  <li>Free</li>
  <li>Designed for beginners</li>
  <li>Motivational</li>
</ol>

<p>And so I began taking coding classes online and at MIT, steadily being sucked into the world of computer science.</p>

        Hello World!

    <h2 id="hi-welcome-to-my-blog">Hi! Welcome to my blog.</h2>

<p>Why start a blog in the first place? As I graduated from <a href="http://mit.edu">MIT</a> last Friday, June 5th, I decided to move out to California to continue the coding education that I began last year in September. Setting up my own website and blog seems like a logical extension of my continued practical education.</p>

<p>What do I want to achieve during my time in Cali? I am not sure whether I will be able to make it as a fully fledged software developer, the more I learn the more I realize that there is so much more to it then simply learning how to code and my visa simply isn’t long enough to give me enough time to compete with the people that major in computer science. I do however want to get an understanding that is thorough enough so I can</p>

<ul>
  <li>understand the basic principles of programming</li>
  <li>talk the lingo of computer scientists</li>
  <li>be able to read and understand snippets of code</li>
  <li>explore to connect the different pieces of code through requests, API’s, databases, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>My aim is ultimately to completely understand the process of how a web application or an iOS application works. How does it connect to a database? How does it communicate with a webserver? What are the current trends in the industry? I am very excited to be exploring these questions in the next couple of months.</p>

<p>In the end I would like to be able to use the technical skills I learned in conjunction with the finance and business skills that I have acquired during my education both at MIT and at Utrecht. The role of a product manager seems to perfectly fit this description. Ideally, I would like to grow into this role by starting my own business.</p>

<p>Over the next weeks and months I will be blogging about all kinds of things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Technical posts explaining what projects I do, I did them and what resources I used</li>
  <li>Thoughts about entrepreneurship (I know there is lot of stuff about this out there already but this will be from my perspective)</li>
  <li>My journey, what I am going through, where I am, what I am doing</li>
  <li>Random Ramblings</li>
</ul>

<p>I am excited to be writing about these things and having people be part of my journey.</p>

<p>Julius</p>

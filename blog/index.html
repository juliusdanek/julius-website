        Building my first iPhone apps
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">23 Jun 2015</span>

    <p>Over the past two weeks I have been following the udacity.com <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/ios-developer-nanodegree--nd003">nanodegree for the Swift programming language</a>. What started off fairly slow with an introductory course to Swift and a first project, building an app that modified your voice when recording, continued with an extremely steep learning curve for the next project - a meme creator application.</p>

<p>In this app, the user would be able to take choose an image or take one with his/her camera and amend “meme-style” text to it. Then the user would be able to save or share the created memes and look at all the created memes in a table. What sounds very easy was actually quite challenging as it involved several important concepts that needed to be applied in order for the application to function:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Understanding the use of UIKit</li>
  <li>Using NSNotifiction Center</li>
  <li>Resizing images</li>
  <li>Accessing the camera roll and the photo library</li>
  <li>Using navigation controller</li>
  <li>Using the tab controller</li>
  <li>Pushing viewcontrollers modally and through different methods</li>
  <li>Setting up table and collection views</li>
  <li>NSDate</li>
</ul>

<p>I started out by setting up a tabbed application in Xcode. The picture shows how my storyboard is set up. For those of you that do not know, the storyboard connects all the visual element of an iOS application. You connect those visual elements to the code behind the app. The code controls the visual elements as well as the data behind an application. This interaction is called the MVC - model view controller. The model is the data, the view are the visual elements and the controller connects the two as well controlling the visual output depending on the data. For more info check out: <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/understanding-model-view-controller/">http://blog.codinghorror.com/understanding-model-view-controller/</a>.</p>

<p>Check out the storyboard for my application. The tab view controller is first. When pressing the button on the top right you navigate to the meme editor. From there, an interaction with the “share” button will bring up the activity controller. Any interaction with that controller will add the meme to the data model and will get displayed in the table view that was also the starting point in the app. When you select a meme in the table view (or the collection view which can be selected in the beginning of the app) you get shown a detail view that allows to edit the meme or delete it.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/meme-storyboard.png" alt="Meme-Me app picture" /></p>

<p>This is the starting point of the app. On the top right you are able to open the meme editor and start editing memes. The view is split into a table view and a collection view, accessible through the tab bar on the bottom. Since the table and collection are not populated with data yet (the user hasn’t created any memes), they are both hidden and a label is displayed instead that tells the user to add a meme first. As you can see, the editing button on the top left is disabled as well.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/meme-empty-table.jpg" alt="Meme-me table view" /></p>

<p>When the “add” button is touched up, the meme-editor pushes up modally (meaning that it is its own contained view, coming up from the bottom, as opposed to navigating deeper into the application to the right, like for example in the settings app on your iPhone). Here you are able to select an image from your camera roll or take one yourself. The image then gets fit into an imageview surrounded by two textfields. These textfields have been modified with custom properties. When you edit the bottom text field, the entire bottom view pushes up. This piece of code was actually quite some work as the viewcontroller has to subscribe to notifications when the keyboard would shift up or down. Once these notifications “arrive”, the screen can be shifted up by the height of the keyboard. After subscribing to notifications, you need to unsubscribe when exiting the view and you also need to implement a function to shift the view back down when the keyboard hides. Code snippet below:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span class="c1">//subscribing to notifications -&gt; This function gets called before the view appears</span>

<p><img src="/assets/images/meme-editor.jpg" alt="Meme Editor" /></p>

<p>After the meme is ready, the user can take touch up the share button on the top left, which brings up an activity controller. The activity controller receives a snapshot of the created image and allows the user to share or save it. Any action except cancel will exit the meme-editor and add the image to the saved memes. Saved memes actually is an array in the app delegate, storing all the memes (apparently this is bad practice but I will learn about different ways of storing data soon). For this purpose I created a custom class Meme that stores the memes original images, the bottom and top text, the memedImage and the date and time created.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/meme-activity.jpg" alt="Meme Activity Controller" /></p>

<p>After choosing an activity, the meme-editor will get exited and we can see the table view populated with the meme that we just created. The edit button allows us to delete the meme. The date created, the top text and the memedImage are displayed in a table cell. Every time the view loads, the table gets updated and re-populated. When touch up on the meme, a detail view pulls up that allows you to see the meme in full detail as well as deleting or editing it. Editing will pull up the meme editor and pass the information stored in the meme struct (topText, bottomText, original image) to the editor, allowing you to start off with the original meme.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/meme-table-full.jpg" alt="Meme Table Populated" title="Populated Table" /></p>

<p>Concluding, I am very satisfied with my progress. The app looks pretty sleek. I still have some issues understanding the whole navigation controller concept and with some of the layout stuff but overall I have a pretty good idea how the MVC concept works and how data gets passed around through the app. I am excited about my next projects.</p>

        Sources of money
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">20 Jun 2015</span>

    <p>This is the first post in a series about fundraising for entrepreneurs. For an overview, navigate to <a href="/finance/2015/06/19/fundraising-101/">fundraising 101</a>.</p>

<p>Sources of money and actors in the venture financing business are abundant. There are angels, accelerators, incubators, VC funds, strategic funds, institutional investors, friends and family, grants, and so on and so on. How should you know what is right for you and what is not? VC money definitely is not always the right answer, as this <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3036130/hit-the-ground-running/why-venture-capital-wasnt-right-for-me-and-15-alternative-funding-sou">blogpost by Laurie Peterson</a> perfectly illustrates. She also provides an excellent overview over the type of sources of funding that you can leverage next to traditional VC funding.</p>

<p>Especially companies in seed or early funding stage can often profit from alternative funding models to traditional, large VCs. The infographic below demonstrates that VCs have been reluctant to make seed stage investments in recent years, even though the sums of money have increased. Early stage deals have been faring better but the number has been decreasing as of this quarter. This evidence clearly warrants a second look at the alternatives, some of which I will illustrate in this post. I will not cover traditional VCs but will assume that the reader is familiar with what a VC fund is.</p>

<h3 id="free-money">“Free Money”</h3>

<p>The first option to consider when fundraising are sources of “free money”, i.e. money that does not imply relinquishing equity in the company or taking on debt obligations. I would differentiate between three major categories here:</p>

<h4 id="grants-and-government-schemes">1. Grants and government schemes</h4>

<p>Grants are an extremely useful way to receive funding for early stage research. Grants are usually an option in university environments and are tied to specific types of research.
<!-- research financing with grants --></p>

<h4 id="competitions">2. Competitions</h4>

<p>Grasshopper has compiled a great list with many available startup competitions(<a href="http://grasshopper.com/blog/startup-competition-guide/">http://grasshopper.com/blog/startup-competition-guide/</a>). 
There is an abundance of entrepreneurship competitions throughout the US and Europe. Most competitions hand out cash-prizes and in many cases offer additional benefits such as consulting, engineering expertise or introductions to further programs. Grasshopper has compiled a great list with many available <a href="http://grasshopper.com/blog/startup-competition-guide/">startup competitions</a>.</p>

<!-- The list below contains a continuously updated list of competitions with prizes. **Feel free to submit competitions [here](TODO: INSERT LINK) for inclusion on the list**
 -->

<!-- Make list with competitions, main prize, location and focus -->

<h4 id="summer-programs">3. Summer programs</h4>

<p>Summer programs are another great way to raise money free of cost with the added benefit of mentorship and often office space for several months. The mentorship aspect is actually the most valuable aspect of the offer. Usually, teams participating in those types of programs are strung together in “classes” and go through the program together. The lessons learned from one another plus many bonus programs, workshops and mentorship lessons that the accelerators offer make these programs tremendously valuable. Since many of these programs are conducted by VCs or by major universities, they are also an excellent opportunity expand your network for possible future funding.</p>

<p>Some of the more prominent summer programs are:</p>

<p><a href="http://summer.hcp.com/">Summer@Highland</a>: Check out their blog at <a href="http://summerathighland.tumblr.com/">http://summerathighland.tumblr.com/</a> for more details and to know what being part of a summer program is like.</p>

<p><a href="http://lsvp.com/summer-fellowships/">Lightspeed Ventures Fellowship</a></p>

<p><a href="http://entrepreneurship.mit.edu/accelerator/">MIT GFSA accelerator</a></p>

<!-- Make list with accelerators and find example blogpost that shows a day in an accelerator.  -->

<p>The caveat with these sources is that you can absolutely not plan for or rely on them. Especially in grants the application process might be very lengthy and burdensome. Competitions and summer programs however are definitely an important stepping stone, giving entrepreneurs the opportunity to re-work pitches, to network and to gain general public exposure for their company.</p>

<h3 id="angels-angel-funds-and-micro-vcs">Angels, Angel Funds and Micro-VCs</h3>

<p>Angels in a nutshell are wealthy individuals that usually have either founded a company before or accumulated significant industry expertise. Angels commonly invest between $100.000 to $1.000.000, or more in exceptional cases. For a brief summary on angel investors, read <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/52742">http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/52742</a>. Next to providing initial seed money, angel investors can be of tremendous help with their usually extensive networks and expertise. Angel investors have the reputation to not make money in the fundraising community as many of their investments are in very risky early stage or seed companies. Studies have shown this conception <a href="http://www.angelblog.net/Angel_Returns.html">not to be true</a>. For some further reading on angels, visit:</p>

<p>Angel investor groups have nuanced differences as well.</p>

<em>Courtesy of: <a href="http://commonangels.com/our-team/management/maia-heymann/">Maya Heymann</a></em></p>

<p><strong>Angel groups:</strong> Angel investor groups or funds consist of several angels that have joined forces in order to combine expertise and to pool financial resources, allowing greater investments. They usually average around 100 members, are region-specific and can differ in the industries they invest in.</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Angel funds:</strong> Angel funds pool individual angels money into a fund that then gets invested. Entrepreneurs have the advantage of having access to larger monetary funds. The fund managers can find the individual angels invested in the fund that would be the best fit for the company as advisors.</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Angel syndicates:</strong> Angel list provides the opportunity for syndicates to co-invest in companies. Hereby individual angels make a pledge to a company and other angels make follow-on investments. The investment of one angel hereby acts as a “social proof” or seal of approval. Usually super star angels will have several followers willing to make co-investments. Thus, secure an investment from one and you might get a few follow-ons.</p>

<p><strong>Micro-VCs</strong> are venture capital funds with smaller amounts of assets under management (AUM), usually below $50m but up to about $100m. Micro-VCs primarily engage in seed and early-stage deals and invest smaller amounts of money. The current early stage average deal size for Micro-VCs is $3.4m. I have included several links for great readings on micro-VCs here:</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="accelerators">Accelerators</h3>

<p>Quoting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_accelerator">Wikipedia</a> here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Seed accelerators also known as startup accelerators are fixed-term, cohort-based programs, that include mentorship and educational components and culminate in a public pitch event or demo day. While traditional business incubators are often government-funded, generally take no equity, and focus on biotech, medical technology, clean tech or product-centric companies, accelerators can be either privately or publicly funded and focus on a wide range of industries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The main differences between business incubators and accelerators are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The application process is open to anyone, but highly competitive. Y Combinator and TechStars have application acceptance rates between 1% and 3%.</li>
  <li>A seed investment in the startups is usually made, in exchange for equity. Typically, the investment is between US$20,000 and US$50,000 (or £10,000 and £50,000 in Europe)</li>
  <li>The focus is on small teams, not on individual founders. Accelerators consider that one person is insufficient to handle all the work associated with a startup.</li>
  <li>The startups must “graduate” by a given deadline, typically after 3 months. During this time, they receive intensive mentoring and training, and they are expected to iterate rapidly. Virtually all accelerators end their programs with a “Demo Day”, where the startups present to investors.</li>
  <li>Startups are accepted and supported in cohort batches or classes (the accelerator isn’t an on-demand resource). The peer support and feedback that the classes provide is an important advantage. If the accelerator doesn’t offer a common workspace, the teams will meet periodically.</li>
</ol>

<p>End quote from Wikipedia. This article gives a very accurate description of accelerators - for detailed rankings of accelerators navigate to <a href="http://www.seedrankings.com/">http://www.seedrankings.com/</a>.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>There is an abundance of alternative funding forms out there. In this post I have tried to give a snapshot. In my the next section - “How to choose the right investor” - I want to cover some of the strategies and caveats when looking for the right investor.</p>

        Fundraising 101
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">19 Jun 2015</span>

    <p>In the startup environment of 2015, a ton of money gets distributed daily to new companies by venture capital firms, angels, institutional investors, individuals and many more actors. Some people insist that we are seeing a major bubble rise. This might be true or not but that does not change the fact that fundraising is one of the <em>main activities</em> of a startups CEO or key personnel. Many entrepreneurs that I met during my time at MIT recounted being more of a “Chief Fundraising Officer” than CEO for the first months of their companies.</p>

<p>This means that any head-start you can get on the fundraising process is of tremendous advantage. In a series of blogposts I want to share with you my insights from two MIT courses that I took on the matter, 10.407 - Money for Startups and 15.431 - Entreprenerial Finance. Disclaimer: I have not gone through funding processes myself yet - but I am planning to do so and I think meticulous preparation is the best way. Speaking with seasoned entrepreneurs, investors, reading blogs and my classes have helped me form a good theoretical idea that I would like to put forward to the reader. This is not a guide on how to pitch your company or how to approach potential investors. This is purely related to the finance process of fundraising. Another caveat: I will not be covering debt-financing either, this is purely equity financing related.</p>

<div class="message">Equity financing means giving up a percentage of your company in return for funds rather than taking on debts that will need to be repaid later on. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modigliani%E2%80%93Miller_theorem" target="_blank">finance theory</a>, there is supposedly no difference between the two, albeit relying on the absence of transaction costs, taxes and a whole other lot of real life issues. This article gives a good overview over the discussion of <a href="http://www.nfib.com/article/ital-50036/" target="_blank">debt- vs. equity financing</a></div>

<p>In the following articles I want to cover seven topics, starting with number 1 below. I will frequently link to other blogs and sites that have good insights for more detailed discussions. I would like to see the blog as a forum for discussion. If you disagree with any of the content, leave a comment. If you have any experience, leave a comment. The more discussion, the better.</p>

        Fallout 4 is coming!!
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">18 Jun 2015</span>

    <h2 id="i-cant-believe-it">I can’t believe it!</h2>

<p>Fallout 4 has been announced a few days ago at the E3. I have spent a ton of time playing both the immediate predecessors Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas as well as Fallout 2, back in the day.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D5esyZPt5Jo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Why do I love this game so much? It has all the ingredients an incredible game needs in my eyes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s a role playing game with an amazing character and leveling system, skills that make sense and a system that levels up skills when used (your lockpicking skill will increase if you successfully pick a lock)</li>
  <li>It is extremely atmospheric.** Bethesda Softworks puts a lot of detailed thought into how to make a game world as credible as possible with dozens and dozens of characters, well-thought out story lines and wonderful landscapes</li>
  <li>The post-apocalyptic scenario: Come on, who wouldn’t want to see what the world would look like after a catastrophe - even though I obviously wouldn’t actually want this to happen.</li>
  <li>Pip-Boy</li>
</ul>

<p>Among the newly announced features is the possibility to build your own settlements and houses - something that I have dearly missed in Bethesda games since you could pseudo-develop your own settlement in ES III: Bloodmoon.</p>

<p>The game will be released on November 10 this year! I am so incredibly excited - I dearly hope I will have the time to play this game.</p>

<p>Until then I am playing Fallout Shelter - a game for iOS that Bethesda just released. It’s perfect for short breaks on your way to work.</p>
